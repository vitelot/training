    catch_conflict(RN, FL::Fleet, parsed_args)

Detect and resolve conflicts arising from insufficient block capacity in the railway network simulation.

# Arguments
- `RN`: Railway network configuration or structure.
- `FL::Fleet`: The fleet of trains participating in the simulation.
- `parsed_args`: Parsed arguments containing configuration options.

# Description
The `catch_conflict` function runs the `one_sim(RN, FL)` simulation to identify blocks where conflicts occur, such as multiple trains occupying the same block. If a conflict arises:
- A `KeyError` is triggered, indicating a missing or insufficiently defined block.
- If the block is identified as a station, the user is warned to update the station data in `../configuration/data/extra-stations.csv`.
- For generic blocks, a warning prompts the user to update the block definitions in `../simulation/data/blocks.csv` to increase track capacity or define missing blocks.

The function continues running the simulation iteratively until no more conflicts are detected, allowing the railway network to adapt dynamically by updating block capacities as needed.
