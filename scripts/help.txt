usage: main.jl [-v] [-i INI] [-t TIMETABLE_FILE] [-b BLOCK_FILE]
               [--speed_test] [--multi_simulation] [--catch_conflict]
               [--inject_delays] [-h]

optional arguments:
  -v, --version         show the simulation's version
  -i, --ini INI         path for the .ini file (default:
                        "../simulation/data/par.ini")
  -t, --timetable_file TIMETABLE_FILE
                        override the path to the timetable file
                        (default: "")
  -b, --block_file BLOCK_FILE
                        override the path to the file with block
                        specifications (default: "")
  --speed_test          perform a speed test on the simulation core
                        using the @time macro -- disable all outputs
  --multi_simulation    a flag for running multiple simulations
  --catch_conflict      a flag for running routines for checking the
                        structure of the railway
  --inject_delays       The program searches for delays to inject in
                        the simulation.                    The
                        corresponding files with the lists of trians
                        to delay must be placed                    in
                        the folder specified in par.ini under
                        imposed_delay_repo_path, which usually
                        is the /data/delays/ folder;
                        If the --multi_simulation flag is not
                        specified, the first ordered delay file is
                        used.
