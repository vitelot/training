Running the simulation with flags --help
julia --project=../environment main.jl --help
usage: main.jl [-v] [-i INI] [-o OUTPUT_PATH] [-t TIMETABLE_FILE]
               [-b BLOCK_FILE] [-s STATION_FILE] [--speed_test]
               [--multi_simulation] [--catch_conflict] [-j]
               [--num_sims NUM_SIMS] [-h]

optional arguments:
  -v, --version         show the simulation's version
  -i, --ini INI         path for the .ini file (default:
                        "../running/simdata/par.ini")
  -o, --output_path OUTPUT_PATH
                        Folder where the generated timetables are to
                        be stored (default: "../running/results")
  -t, --timetable_file TIMETABLE_FILE
                        override the path to the timetable file
                        (default: "")
  -b, --block_file BLOCK_FILE
                        override the path to the file with block
                        specifications (default: "")
  -s, --station_file STATION_FILE
                        override the path to the file with station
                        specifications (default: "")
  --speed_test          perform a speed test on the simulation core
                        using the @time macro -- disable all outputs
  --multi_simulation    a flag for running multiple simulations
  --catch_conflict      a flag for running routines for checking the
                        structure of the railway. It is currently
                        disabled.
  -j, --inject_delays   The program searches for delays to inject in
                        the simulation. The corresponding files with
                        the lists of trains to delay must be placed in
                        the folder specified in par.ini under
                        imposed_delay_repo_path, which usually is the
                        /data/delays/ folder;                    If
                        the --multi_simulation flag is not specified,
                        the first ordered delay file is used.
  --num_sims NUM_SIMS   The number of simulations to carry out. This
                        number should at most be the number of
                        delay files available. By default the number
                        of simulations would be equal to the
                        total number of delay files. (type: Int64,
                        default: -1)
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
